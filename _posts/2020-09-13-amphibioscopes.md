**2020-September-13, Volans (Apr 22 - June 1)**: Certain people may be dragging their feet, even though they appear to be doing okay, but you know the old saying: "Thinking is believing." You know you have things to do and you know the old saying is still true: "Some things are easier than others, and some things are tougher than others. Your amphibian spiritual guide [Mercurana myristicapalustris](https://amphibiaweb.org/cgi/amphib_query?where-genus=Mercurana&where-species=myristicapalustris) hopes you will adopt some of its behaviors as your own. <br /><br />**2020-September-13, Eridanus (June 2 - July 17)**: You will have to make allowances for those who, on the surface at least, seem to enjoy making you feel small but deep down you know that it’s time to make yourself known. Don’t hold grudges if they start coming your way. Your amphibian spiritual guide [Abavorana nazgul](https://amphibiaweb.org/cgi/amphib_query?where-genus=Abavorana&where-species=nazgul) reminds you to leave any kind of nesting sites: ditch after ditch has been cleared. Froglets in submerged water should stay in the water. Rhinoderma tormota and R. darwinii species are particularly abundant in this species habitat. <br /><br />**2020-September-13, Scutum (July 18 - Sept 1)**: You may want to do something to cheer up the outside world today but the planets warn that is not going to happen. They also say you should not be running around wild, so you might as well be a bit touchy. Your amphibian spiritual guide [Tylototriton panhai](https://amphibiaweb.org/cgi/amphib_query?where-genus=Tylototriton&where-species=panhai) warns that the species may be cannibalistic. Males were never observed to leave the female's reproductive zone. <br /><br />**2020-September-13, Hercules (Sept 2 - Oct 17)**: What happens today will change everything, of course, so don’t get uptight if your chores and duties are taken away. If you are allowed to be alone with your thoughts today you will have to find a quiet place to sit and think about them – until Thursday. Your amphibian spiritual guide [Allobates flaviventris](https://amphibiaweb.org/cgi/amphib_query?where-genus=Allobates&where-species=flaviventris) urges you not to eat (or touch) unattended, even in areas where there is a well-ventilated space. <br /><br />**2020-September-13, Phoenix (Oct 18 - Dec 2)**: You can and you must be true to who you are and what you believe. Don’t let anyone tell you that you are not entitled to be happy. You are who you are and that’s enough – if you like what you hear immediately you will give it another day. Your amphibian spiritual guide [Hydromantes strinatii](https://amphibiaweb.org/cgi/amphib_query?where-genus=Hydromantes&where-species=strinatii) urges you to stay away from areas that are "where the fun is all the calling." The warning sounds like a high-pitched growl. <br /><br />**2020-September-13, Lepus (Dec 3 - Jan 17)**: You may have to work harder than usual to get what you want but that’s no bad thing. Sometimes even a Lepus needs a shoulder to cry on, so pull your weight and help people in need. Your amphibian spiritual guide [Kaloula pulchra](https://amphibiaweb.org/cgi/amphib_query?where-genus=Kaloula&where-species=pulchra) reminds you to be true to yourself. It is probably no more than a passing relative of this species than of other frogs or of cockroaches in the genus Scaphiophryne. <br /><br />**2020-September-13, Circinus (Jan 18 - Mar 4)**: Something new will appear in your mind today and if you look carefully you will see what you are looking for – you don’t have to look far. Over the next few days, come to any conclusions, that little thing that is lurking in your mind will reach out to you and make you smile. Your amphibian spiritual guide [Leptodactylus latrans](https://amphibiaweb.org/cgi/amphib_query?where-genus=Leptodactylus&where-species=latrans) warns that the calling males tend to be younger than the adult frogs, at least in the southern part of the frog genus (Leptodactylus et al. 2014). <br /><br />**2020-September-13, Coma Berenices (Mar 5 - Apr 21)**: This is the kind of day when making changes for the worse is more likely than not, so don’t try to force yourself. Even if you can’t show that you deserve some kind of reward, you can at least pretend that you own up to a mistake. It’s no big deal. Your amphibian spiritual guide [Boophis tampoka](https://amphibiaweb.org/cgi/amphib_query?where-genus=Boophis&where-species=tampoka) wishes to encourage the free-swimming frog (RÃ¶del 1995). Sometimes they call from the ground or from elevated positions up to 50 cm above the ground. One male laid about 20 eggs. Tadpoles live in torrents or small rainforest streams. They are yellowish, covered with brown spots. <br /><br />
