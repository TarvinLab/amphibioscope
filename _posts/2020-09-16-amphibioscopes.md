**2020-September-16, Volans (Apr 22 - June 1)**: If you need to say something emotionally it may hurt someone who is emotionally attached to you, especially a friend or relative. That is one of those things that could easily happen if you were to let their feelings get the better of you. But it won’t hurt a thing. Your amphibian spiritual guide [Hyalinobatrachium dianae](https://amphibiaweb.org/cgi/amphib_query?where-genus=Hyalinobatrachium&where-species=dianae) wishes to be included in their ornamental repertoire. [Hyalinobatrachium dianae](https://amphibiaweb.org/cgi/amphib_query?where-genus=Hyalinobatrachium&where-species=dianae) is a spring or summer breeder, breeding in well-oxygenated breeding pools (LÃ¶tters et al. 2008). <br /><br />**2020-September-16, Eridanus (June 2 - July 17)**: There is no point getting annoyed about things you view as less important. Sit down with them and discuss the situation in depth – you have plenty of reasons why you should not be getting involved. You may even be surprised you found the time to do it all yourself. Your amphibian spiritual guide [Clinotarsus curtipes](https://amphibiaweb.org/cgi/amphib_query?where-genus=Clinotarsus&where-species=curtipes) reminds you to keep a cool head during the day and sometimes retreat to water on its sides or on the banks where it does its best living hibernating. <br /><br />**2020-September-16, Scutum (July 18 - Sept 1)**: The Sun in your opposite sign will make all things possible over the next few days but you must not let that stop you from trying to make things happen. Don’t just aim to be happy but to be successful too. The more you do for other people the more you will do for yourself. Your amphibian spiritual guide [Atelopus limosus](https://amphibiaweb.org/cgi/amphib_query?where-genus=Atelopus&where-species=limosus) reminds you to follow the stream closely when calling since the species has a "limbs crawling" posture in which the tail is raisedpole-back. Calling behavior is very similar to that of Atelopus varius (Franzen & sagol 1934). Males startcalling between dusk and dawn and ending the day with low to mid-morning calls. <br /><br />**2020-September-16, Hercules (Sept 2 - Oct 17)**: You must not, under any circumstances, let your ambitions take over your life. Others won’t be happy if you get a bit more out of the day if you let certain restrictions get out of hand. Take the fight to them. Your amphibian spiritual guide [Ambystoma andersoni](https://amphibiaweb.org/cgi/amphib_query?where-genus=Ambystoma&where-species=andersoni) warns that certain classes of frogs may prey on young tadpoles (possibly on them) while leaving them as they are (for now) immature and not eating or active during the dry season. <br /><br />**2020-September-16, Phoenix (Oct 18 - Dec 2)**: Any efforts that start to bog you down will be a bore, so get out there and get people involved – it’s not a case of "I will get this person some money if you help me but don’t tell the truth." Your amphibian spiritual guide [Desmognathus wrighti](https://amphibiaweb.org/cgi/amphib_query?where-genus=Desmognathus&where-species=wrighti) urges you to stay away from populated areas. "Ring-shaped individuals are active primarily in arboreal habitats, hunting bolitograna, red-footed salamanders, and fallow forest vegetation above 1 m. Typically, ring-shaped individuals are ~20 mm in length. <br /><br />**2020-September-16, Lepus (Dec 3 - Jan 17)**: You may have a brilliant idea but don’t start working on it yet. A few days from now you will look back and realize how much you were wrong and how little has been done to make your vision come true. Then do it. Your amphibian spiritual guide [Genyophryne thomsoni](https://amphibiaweb.org/cgi/amphib_query?where-genus=Genyophryne&where-species=thomsoni) urges you to watch out for individuals whose movements may be unpredictable, since they can easily escape capture by crossing the line into over-femoralization. They are, however, very vulnerable to predators, and can easily be injured by direct injury to the vocal sacs. The author has developed P. <br /><br />**2020-September-16, Circinus (Jan 18 - Mar 4)**: You must pay attention to what your instincts tell you today. If they tell you otherwise you should ignore them, because if you are smart you will ignore them now. Most likely there is nothing to worry about. Your amphibian spiritual guide [Heleioporus inornatus](https://amphibiaweb.org/cgi/amphib_query?where-genus=Heleioporus&where-species=inornatus) reminds you to swim low-lyingly or with open banks in low-lying areas. Breeding is usually in the form of a single egg sac attached to a pole or rock. Eggs hatch after heavy rain creates a floating egg sac that is 25 - 30 mm in total length. <br /><br />**2020-September-16, Coma Berenices (Mar 5 - Apr 21)**: This is a great time to be of service to other people, but because you are currently the only one who does not believe in miracles you may have to be a bit suspicious. Your amphibian spiritual guide [Leptopelis spiritusnoctis](https://amphibiaweb.org/cgi/amphib_query?where-genus=Leptopelis&where-species=spiritusnoctis) wishes to emphasize the detailed information it contains. However, it is clear that it is not a fully capable spiritual guide due to its lack of a fully developed head and tail.  A more complete description will be provided elsewhere. <br /><br />
