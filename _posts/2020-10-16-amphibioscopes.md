**2020-October-16, Volans (Apr 22 - June 1)**: You have this vague feeling that something is not right, and you go into denial and hope that it will be the opposite to the way you expected it to be. No, it really isn’t that bad. Your amphibian spiritual guide [Hyla eximia](https://amphibiaweb.org/cgi/amphib_query?where-genus=Hyla&where-species=eximia) wishes to emphasize the two small black boxes stuck out of water. This is most likely a result of the fact that Hyla hypomykterus uses its head as a substratum for colorating (Mahony 2002). <br /><br />**2020-October-16, Eridanus (June 2 - July 17)**: You will have lots of fun this weekend and may even have some extra cash in your pocket. Don’t be suspicious if someone you live or work with makes less than you because they are not trying to cheat you. They may be trying to trick you but that’s how it usually is. Your amphibian spiritual guide [Telmatobius culeus](https://amphibiaweb.org/cgi/amphib_query?where-genus=Telmatobius&where-species=culeus) reminds you to stay within its territory during the breeding season. Walk on the water as it is warm and stream-like, with small pools on the banks and at the top. Store away while near water: specimens in cold water will stay under branches or plants until they are used for cooking (IUCN 2008). <br /><br />**2020-October-16, Scutum (July 18 - Sept 1)**: Not much sense at all is a pain when the pain is so real. The only reason you feel the need to get up and go elsewhere is because you are not thinking straight or thinking clearly and you may never get back in the right frame of mind with those you love. Your amphibian spiritual guide [Sclerophrys pantherina](https://amphibiaweb.org/cgi/amphib_query?where-genus=Sclerophrys&where-species=pantherina) urges you to observe the behavior of the known salamanders, and to compare their behaviors to those of the known mites. The publications on this subject are presented in detail by Krakauer and BÃ¶hme 1996, and are by Karraker et al. 2000. <br /><br />**2020-October-16, Hercules (Sept 2 - Oct 17)**: Anything is possible if you want it enough at the moment. If you want it enough – and you do – now is the time to express your desire. It’s not the least bit necessary. Your amphibian spiritual guide [Anomaloglossus stepheni](https://amphibiaweb.org/cgi/amphib_query?where-genus=Anomaloglossus&where-species=stepheni) warns that the frogs in this species are quite inactive for a species of this species that is as common as Ticamomam (22.9%) and the fourth most abundant (7.9%) in A. lehmange (1958). <br /><br />**2020-October-16, Phoenix (Oct 18 - Dec 2)**: You are under no obligation to be nice to someone but you are also no obligation to be nice to them in return. If you come on too strong today you could turn colleagues against you. If you don’t, you’ll scare them off. Your amphibian spiritual guide [Platymantis guentheri](https://amphibiaweb.org/cgi/amphib_query?where-genus=Platymantis&where-species=guentheri) urges you not to take any unusual trips or migrations of any species, calling them "hybridism." Calling consists of a series of short, high-pitched "chips," with the first three notes emphasized. <br /><br />**2020-October-16, Lepus (Dec 3 - Jan 17)**: If you force yourself to be enthusiastic about a certain task or project it may not come up again for a while. It may well be a chore, but it must be done. And if you are not yet certified then you should be. Your amphibian spiritual guide [Austrochaperina archboldi](https://amphibiaweb.org/cgi/amphib_query?where-genus=Austrochaperina&where-species=archboldi) wishes there were fewer predators on the islands than were in Perugina. <br /><br />**2020-October-16, Circinus (Jan 18 - Mar 4)**: You have no time for people who get on your nerves. You will get through a lecture this week without getting angry because you are a serious person by nature. However, this may not be a good time to say anything too personal. Your amphibian spiritual guide [Limnodynastes terraereginae](https://amphibiaweb.org/cgi/amphib_query?where-genus=Limnodynastes&where-species=terraereginae) hopes that by being selective in its diet he can bring about the conservation of its kind in other species on the planet. Only Melaleuca has the potential to create a new species of frog: it produced a fully formed larva that is already specialized for that species. <br /><br />**2020-October-16, Coma Berenices (Mar 5 - Apr 21)**: You are in the mood to take a few risks and make new friends – yes, even more! You may fear the worst for the next few days because you cannot work out why you are suddenly so angry, but you will find it easier to understand why people are so strongly in your cause. Your amphibian spiritual guide [Mantidactylus opiparis](https://amphibiaweb.org/cgi/amphib_query?where-genus=Mantidactylus&where-species=opiparis) reminds you of a spirit living in the water, calling upon water to its depth of about 3 meters. The calling spirit is usually felt on the back of a small, slow-moving katakami, or on the ground or in the ground-covered relict with bugs and beetles. <br /><br />
