**2020-October-20, Volans (Apr 22 - June 1)**: With the Sun moving through the wellbeing area of your chart you will find it easier than ever to love your life and take time off from work. But don’t go on a spree because if you do you may regret it later when you have to turn back and have to buy expensive new things. Your amphibian spiritual guide [Pseudophilautus malcolmsmithi](https://amphibiaweb.org/cgi/amphib_query?where-genus=Pseudophilautus&where-species=malcolmsmithi) wishes they were a bat. These frogs have a tooth formula of 1,1+1/1+1. Tooth formula 1 is red-hot, and the surrounding jelly is milky. <br /><br />**2020-October-20, Eridanus (June 2 - July 17)**: What happens today will leave you feeling a bit drained, but in a way that’s good. You may have to swim a bit today as there are fewer resources at your disposal, but you will also find ways to mix with those whose beliefs are in some way outside of you. Your amphibian spiritual guide [Xenopus lenduensis](https://amphibiaweb.org/cgi/amphib_query?where-genus=Xenopus&where-species=lenduensis) hopes that by using its unusually intricate visual organ, it can "walk" on water's surface "like a human walking on a horse" (Baha El Din 2002). The organ is also shown to be more sensitive than previously thought (Kunte 2004). <br /><br />**2020-October-20, Scutum (July 18 - Sept 1)**: This will be a challenging day, especially for an Scutum who is confident about who they are and what they can do. Don’t let anyone tell you that you don’t deserve to succeed – you’ve done your bit for the right reasons and now you want to be a leader. Your amphibian spiritual guide [Oreolalax multipunctatus](https://amphibiaweb.org/cgi/amphib_query?where-genus=Oreolalax&where-species=multipunctatus) reminds you to breathe mainly (Veiwaz et al. 2003), and also to stand up straight (i.e. take notes) (Hamad and Kaya 2009). <br /><br />**2020-October-20, Hercules (Sept 2 - Oct 17)**: No matter how much your rivals may try to undermine your confidence you must not let your pride suffer. In a matter of days something will happen that makes you realize just how weak you really are. Don’t try to do everything by yourself – work yourself to the bone. Your amphibian spiritual guide [Ranitomeya sirensis](https://amphibiaweb.org/cgi/amphib_query?where-genus=Ranitomeya&where-species=sirensis) wishes to thank our publisher for its abundant resources of fertilized eggs.  Its eggs were within the reproductive zone of a bromeliad root canthmus leaf in a tropical forest. It lays eggs in moist, leaf-hole-like soil. The larval diet consists of arthropods, worms, and mollusks. <br /><br />**2020-October-20, Phoenix (Oct 18 - Dec 2)**: You will get up and go wherever you please today – but you won’t get anywhere on purpose. Your amphibian spiritual guide [Oedipina carablanca](https://amphibiaweb.org/cgi/amphib_query?where-genus=Oedipina&where-species=carablanca) urges you to avoid touching territories it is familiar with, as it increases the chances of speciation at the time of Oedopo.ie research (Hanken and Wake 1982). <br /><br />**2020-October-20, Lepus (Dec 3 - Jan 17)**: You may be plagued by irrational fears at the moment but you must not be afraid of what you might experience. It may seem as if your reality is making you fear the worst but only because you fear it so much. Life is an experiment – so be patient. Your amphibian spiritual guide [Cophixalus kaindiensis](https://amphibiaweb.org/cgi/amphib_query?where-genus=Cophixalus&where-species=kaindiensis) warns that while it inhabits most agricultural land, it also occurs in some forest. It is most likely to breed and gather around the time of monsoonal rains, as both sexes form breeding flanks. <br /><br />**2020-October-20, Circinus (Jan 18 - Mar 4)**: You are in a friendly and forgiving mood at the moment, which is nice in a way but don’t give up on someone just because you have to give them something back. You’ve had enough of their stuff – it’s junk you won’t like if you leave it. Your amphibian spiritual guide [Taudactylus diurnus](https://amphibiaweb.org/cgi/amphib_query?where-genus=Taudactylus&where-species=diurnus) hopes you will too, but willingly suggests that other species have been targeted for sub-species selection. Calling frogs are great in numbers (around 1000) and may cause offence by shifting their ached posture (Heyer and Willems 2018). <br /><br />**2020-October-20, Coma Berenices (Mar 5 - Apr 21)**: Don’t waste time lamenting the kind of mistakes you have made or the kind of mistakes you still have to make. What happens today will remind you that your successes earned you so much good fortune. Your amphibian spiritual guide [Wakea madinika](https://amphibiaweb.org/cgi/amphib_query?where-genus=Wakea&where-species=madinika) hopes you will feed on the bugs (RÃ¶del et al. 2008). <br /><br />
