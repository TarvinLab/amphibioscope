Don’t let their insistence catch you out. Your amphibian spiritual guide [Aquiloeurycea cafetalera](https://amphibiaweb.org/cgi/amphib_query?where-genus=Aquiloeurycea&where-species=cafetalera) wishes to be avoided since it is toxic and difficult to treat with antihypertensive and antipositives (Boehme et al 1999). <br /><br />**2020-November-06, Lepus (Dec 3 - Jan 17)**: You may think you can do as you please, now can you, but will you act on your impulses?

It may not be easy but common sense should tell you there is no need to worry. You are in one of those moods where you just can’t take life too seriously. Your amphibian spiritual guide [Guibemantis tornieri](https://amphibiaweb.org/cgi/amphib_query?where-genus=Guibemantis&where-species=tornieri) urges you to observe and repent of one's problems.
