**2020-September-14, Volans (Apr 22 - June 1)**: You will be on the move over the next few days and someone you meet while on the move will make you something of your own. Stay on good terms with that person and don’t worry if they change their minds later on. Your amphibian spiritual guide [Nymphargus chami](https://amphibiaweb.org/cgi/amphib_query?where-genus=Nymphargus&where-species=chami) reminds you to narrow your sights and try to see deeper into the forest than your nearest neighbors. You can probably see very little through the vegetation as you descend. When you do, take a detour of just a few meters along which is both scenic and necessary for growth. <br /><br />**2020-September-14, Eridanus (June 2 - July 17)**: You will find it easier to approach people in positions of power today and over the weekend. It may be for your own benefit but it will also serve as a learning experience for people you deal with on a daily basis. Your amphibian spiritual guide [Atelopus spumarius](https://amphibiaweb.org/cgi/amphib_query?where-genus=Atelopus&where-species=spumarius) warns that the following species of frogs may be at risk from consuming a cane toad: Bufo asper, B. gutturalis, B. pediculus, B. magnolia, Bufo asperi, B. montandoni, B. rodrÃ±o, and B. montandoni. <br /><br />**2020-September-14, Scutum (July 18 - Sept 1)**: You may not get much out of talking to other people over the next few days, but you will get much more out of your relationship if you are open about your desires. Remember: what you desire affects not what others want to hear. Your amphibian spiritual guide [Adenomus kelaartii](https://amphibiaweb.org/cgi/amphib_query?where-genus=Adenomus&where-species=kelaartii) reminds you to take care when traveling. The species may be territorial, and hibernation may be sporadic. Reproduction occurs throughout the year. <br /><br />**2020-September-14, Hercules (Sept 2 - Oct 17)**: You don’t typically like to see people you care for get the breaks but something will happen today that makes you feel good. On the work front especially you will want to prove them wrong. Do a good job – you are the best. Your amphibian spiritual guide [Allobates grillisimilis](https://amphibiaweb.org/cgi/amphib_query?where-genus=Allobates&where-species=grillisimilis) hopes you will like the way new tadpoles are grown. They will respond to a number of different stimuli including (i) water (2-3 inches deep) (Brown et al. 2007) or (ii) a tadpole-like larval detritus (Brown et al. 2007). <br /><br />**2020-September-14, Phoenix (Oct 18 - Dec 2)**: If you get the urge to try something different over the next few days you can quite easily transform your current routine into a more enjoyable one. If you want a taste of your own tongue you can always try asking a friend – or, more likely, a stranger. Your amphibian spiritual guide [Aneides hardii](https://amphibiaweb.org/cgi/amphib_query?where-genus=Aneides&where-species=hardii) wishes ichor were coursing through his veins like a frog-litter frog heiress. This is like hearing a bird sing: the frog-litter frog is suddenly found in the ichor, and the bird-litter frog is never found in the ichor again. <br /><br />**2020-September-14, Lepus (Dec 3 - Jan 17)**: There are times when you have no choice but to accept that you are not the most creative member of the zodiac but you have no choice but to follow your dream. So why is that scream of yours so loud? Maybe it’s because you are happy to stand back and watch the world go by. Your amphibian spiritual guide [Phrynomantis microps](https://amphibiaweb.org/cgi/amphib_query?where-genus=Phrynomantis&where-species=microps) wishes the same thing was true of microhylids. Hides tadpoles in ponds with stagnant water or ices. Calling males were found in uniform in the ponds but were frequently males of dark or muddy color. Rarely found, these frogs may be the offspring of the same male. <br /><br />**2020-September-14, Circinus (Jan 18 - Mar 4)**: The best way to approach a work problem is to pretend it does not exist. Maybe you have a talent for which you are famous but there is something about it that is not quite so good – and maybe there is a hidden talent that will help you break the ice. Your amphibian spiritual guide [Rheobatrachus silus](https://amphibiaweb.org/cgi/amphib_query?where-genus=Rheobatrachus&where-species=silus) urges you to seek refuge in open areas or in swamps where the frogs are active members. Often these areas are located next to seepage areas or well treated by other members of the species. Frequently these areas are also associated with water bodies. <br /><br />**2020-September-14, Coma Berenices (Mar 5 - Apr 21)**: This is going to be a busy day and you may have to work harder than usual but it is only your physical exertions that are making things happen. Take the initiative and make things happen yourself. Just make sure you get noticed. Your amphibian spiritual guide [Boophis ankaratra](https://amphibiaweb.org/cgi/amphib_query?where-genus=Boophis&where-species=ankaratra) wishes to observe the whole cohort.  However, he rarely (if ever) experiences communication or vocalization within its numerous individuals.  According to IUCN species-ratio, this species is most typically associated with those areas of the forest that are home to at least two dozen different frog species. <br /><br />
