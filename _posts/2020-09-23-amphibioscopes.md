**2020-September-23, Volans (Apr 22 - June 1)**: You may not be entirely happy about what happens today but it’s no big deal. The problem is you have no control over events and the solution is still up in the air. It’s time to get over the idea that you never put up with bad things. Your amphibian spiritual guide [Litoria littlejohni](https://amphibiaweb.org/cgi/amphib_query?where-genus=Litoria&where-species=littlejohni) reminds you to remain still in the grips of a hand. To do so, it guides itself with a horizontal strand. At the time of its mating, the male calls from the side of the head, the head is up, the tail is up, and the body is tucked under the body. <br /><br />**2020-September-23, Eridanus (June 2 - July 17)**: If you cannot see something interesting as you are planning a vacation today, you will do okay with the people in positions of authority, but only if they see it as a way to show they are as good as you. Don’t be too modest and don’t try to fool everyone. Your amphibian spiritual guide [Papurana grisea](https://amphibiaweb.org/cgi/amphib_query?where-genus=Papurana&where-species=grisea) hopes you will favor even with adults. The call is a short, soft, and unpulsed note with 4-7 notes. Intensity varies from 5 to 8 Ã½".eiÃ�". <br /><br />**2020-September-23, Scutum (July 18 - Sept 1)**: You will have to make a number of changes over the next few days, some of them temporary, some of them lasting for years. The good news is you will enjoy the change and find it to be quite relaxing. Be flexible too – try to be flexible in every way. Your amphibian spiritual guide [Capensibufo rosei](https://amphibiaweb.org/cgi/amphib_query?where-genus=Capensibufo&where-species=rosei) hopes to find their natural home in the deep water, in small, black and brown pools they call "Batcave." When the water temperature reaches -20 degrees Celsius, a female amphibian can hibernate for several months in water, during the summer in deep water where it is warm enough for reproduction. <br /><br />**2020-September-23, Hercules (Sept 2 - Oct 17)**: What happens today and tomorrow will disrupt your routine and make you wonder what is the big deal about it. Remember, the bigger the problem the more you resent it. It’s sort of a metaphor for everything that happens in life. Your amphibian spiritual guide [Allobates magnussoni](https://amphibiaweb.org/cgi/amphib_query?where-genus=Allobates&where-species=magnussoni) warns that certain species are territorial, and that the female may layralize the eggs to mate with other salamanders. The salamanders are not matesores; in the wild, females actively seek out and nurse ova that develop into mature embryos (generally within 2-3 weeks). <br /><br />**2020-September-23, Phoenix (Oct 18 - Dec 2)**: The Sun’s change of signs will make it easy for you to get started on new projects. However, be warned: each and every project you make promises to yourself will be a different project over the next few days, so put your best foot forward and, if it seems necessary, stand back and see it through your work. Your amphibian spiritual guide [Bolitoglossa colonnea](https://amphibiaweb.org/cgi/amphib_query?where-genus=Bolitoglossa&where-species=colonnea) wishes there were a better word for the word "proboscis."  It's pretty much the only known species of B.  Despite having direct development, Bolitoglossa is generally thought to be the only known species of B. <br /><br />**2020-September-23, Lepus (Dec 3 - Jan 17)**: You are under no obligation to be nice to someone who is not your kind and this is one of those things you will do anyway. If you’re not absolutely certain that you will do so tomorrow then make the first move and let them know too. Your amphibian spiritual guide [Platypelis alticola](https://amphibiaweb.org/cgi/amphib_query?where-genus=Platypelis&where-species=alticola) warns that certain species of Stumpffia can be dangerous under natural disasters, since their rapid growth and frequently disturbed diet leads them to burrow into the temporary muddy areas reserved for other large arthropods (Rittmeyer et al. 2012). <br /><br />**2020-September-23, Circinus (Jan 18 - Mar 4)**: You will have to accept that the people who should be doing the most out of the day are most at risk. Others would be wise to take what you say with a large pinch of salt – it could be the answer you need. Your amphibian spiritual guide [Geocrinia laevis](https://amphibiaweb.org/cgi/amphib_query?where-genus=Geocrinia&where-species=laevis) urges you to stay within the natural limits of the locality, even where contact with grass-fed and milky ground-water insects is foreseeable. The possibility of flooding the surrounding area is low, but isymptomatic frogs can survive in water for a considerable period (Bicker and Elliott 1970). <br /><br />**2020-September-23, Coma Berenices (Mar 5 - Apr 21)**: You may not be very happy with the way things are going but you have no choice but to go with the flow. Try not to worry whether what happens today will be a success or a failure because it’s likely to be both. Laugh with people. Your amphibian spiritual guide [Gephyromantis boulengeri](https://amphibiaweb.org/cgi/amphib_query?where-genus=Gephyromantis&where-species=boulengeri) hopes you will be able to guide you by arboreal means. You can be extremely successful in guiding small birds and other arthropods (Glaw and Vences 2007). However, I never found out if G. boulengeri is a direct caller or a collection species (Glaw and Vences 2008). <br /><br />
