**2020-August-29, Volans (Apr 22 - June 1)**: If you are not feeling on top of the world right at this moment you may have to stop and think about it a while ago. It may have happened to you but it may happen to them all time soon. Your amphibian spiritual guide [Charadrahyla altipotens](https://amphibiaweb.org/cgi/amphib_query?where-genus=Charadrahyla&where-species=altipotens) urges you to avoid vocalizing yourself. Rather, it is an effective defensive mechanism, as is the case for other members of the genus Pseudophilautus (Schmidt 1933; Duellman 1970). https://amphibiaweb.org/cgi/amphib_query?where-genus=Charadrahyla&where-species=altipotens<br /><br />**2020-August-29, Eridanus (June 2 - July 17)**: You come in for criticism sometimes and you are not afraid to take a few risks or shine a spotlight on situations that are not flattering. But don’t be taken for a fool or taken for granted. Stay focused and keep moving forward. Your amphibian spiritual guide [Rana coreana](https://amphibiaweb.org/cgi/amphib_query?where-genus=Rana&where-species=coreana) urges you to take care of territorial calls, calling during the dry season, because they are likely to be similar in function to those of the adult frog (Chao et al. 2011). https://amphibiaweb.org/cgi/amphib_query?where-genus=Rana&where-species=coreana<br /><br />**2020-August-29, Scutum (July 18 - Sept 1)**: You have more in common than most people but how much is that really worth? According to the planets you may feel a bit run down today but you won’t feel down for a long time, so hang around a while. Think about it. Your amphibian spiritual guide [Caecilia volcani](https://amphibiaweb.org/cgi/amphib_query?where-genus=Caecilia&where-species=volcani) wishes to emphasize the "deep" species range. In this species range, "depth" usually includes the length of the water-trees, the banks of land on which the breeding animals gather, and the substratum of the aquatic vegetation. https://amphibiaweb.org/cgi/amphib_query?where-genus=Caecilia&where-species=volcani<br /><br />**2020-August-29, Hercules (Sept 2 - Oct 17)**: Something unexpected will disrupt your day today, such as a loved one telling you that they are sorry they broke your promise and won’t be coming back. The message should be simple: don’t let it happen again. Your amphibian spiritual guide [Ameerega braccata](https://amphibiaweb.org/cgi/amphib_query?where-genus=Ameerega&where-species=braccata) reminds you to remain perched on active rocks or leaf litter indicating food sources, to remain presentable at elevated altitudes (Silverstone 1976). https://amphibiaweb.org/cgi/amphib_query?where-genus=Ameerega&where-species=braccata<br /><br />**2020-August-29, Phoenix (Oct 18 - Dec 2)**: You will spend a lot of time today trying to work out what exactly is going on – and what exactly you should be doing about it. It may not be easy but you can do as you please, so give it some thought and, if it seems right to you, don’t let it go any further. Your amphibian spiritual guide [Eurycea subfluvicola](https://amphibiaweb.org/cgi/amphib_query?where-genus=Eurycea&where-species=subfluvicola) urges you to take no chances with money. "Good luck is afoot, and a foot very nearly, if ever it is possible," he writes. Good luck would be great if it were not so paralyzing. https://amphibiaweb.org/cgi/amphib_query?where-genus=Eurycea&where-species=subfluvicola<br /><br />**2020-August-29, Lepus (Dec 3 - Jan 17)**: Something you are working on may seem impractical to you but this is no time to worry about it. Your amphibian spiritual guide [Austrochaperina aquilonia](https://amphibiaweb.org/cgi/amphib_query?where-genus=Austrochaperina&where-species=aquilonia) reminds you to take care when swimming. If the water temperatures are too high, larvae will retreat into cavities or crevices in loose soil or in compacted vegetation. Otherwise, they retreat to low vegetation at or near the surface. https://amphibiaweb.org/cgi/amphib_query?where-genus=Austrochaperina&where-species=aquilonia<br /><br />**2020-August-29, Circinus (Jan 18 - Mar 4)**: You may feel a bit out of touch with the rest of the world this weekend but it’s no big deal. What matters is that you stick with it and don’t give up on it. What is new again will arrive at you quicker after the Sun changes signs on Friday. Your amphibian spiritual guide [Crinia parinsignifera](https://amphibiaweb.org/cgi/amphib_query?where-genus=Crinia&where-species=parinsignifera) urges you not to go to the same length for several similar species of forest floor because of the risks it might create. He suggests raising the breeding distance by a factor of at least 5 (Heyer and Rand 1977). https://amphibiaweb.org/cgi/amphib_query?where-genus=Crinia&where-species=parinsignifera<br /><br />**2020-August-29, Coma Berenices (Mar 5 - Apr 21)**: What happens over the next few days may not be what you were hoping to hear but it will give you the chance to make your mark. Something that has been a secret won’t have to be secret any more: it’s a family affair that matters more. Your amphibian spiritual guide [Wakea madinika](https://amphibiaweb.org/cgi/amphib_query?where-genus=Wakea&where-species=madinika) reminds you of a human being, the tip of which is shaped as a foot. The species was found at gravid females with tephra webbing at permanent and temporary ponds in the Ankaratra Massif. In these temporary pools small frogs (mostly dark brown) are kept in by adult females. https://amphibiaweb.org/cgi/amphib_query?where-genus=Wakea&where-species=madinika<br /><br />
