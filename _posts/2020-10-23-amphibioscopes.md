**2020-October-23, Volans (Apr 22 - June 1)**: You will get all sorts of interesting advice over the next 24 hours but before you start asking silly questions you might be wise not to take it. The person whose advice you most desperately need may be out of your life – and that means you – for now. Your amphibian spiritual guide [Raorchestes dubois](https://amphibiaweb.org/cgi/amphib_query?where-genus=Raorchestes&where-species=dubois) urges you not to take chances with your eggs. The maggot-filled eggs may very well hatch and hatch multiple times before being fed into L. <br /><br />**2020-October-23, Eridanus (June 2 - July 17)**: You may have to revise your plans to take advantage of the new moon but don’t take them too seriously. This is still a great time for career ambitions and the best time to be in the spotlight, especially if it brings your attention to what you are doing. Your amphibian spiritual guide [Cycloramphus faustoi](https://amphibiaweb.org/cgi/amphib_query?where-genus=Cycloramphus&where-species=faustoi) urges you to remain within the natural range of your range (or vice-versa). This is very rarely, if ever, an encounter with captive frogs, and the R. faustodesspecies is known to consume several inches of flesh every day (Crump 1972). <br /><br />**2020-October-23, Scutum (July 18 - Sept 1)**: If you need to ask someone a favor just say “no.” When the Sun changes signs tomorrow you will have to explain your reluctance, or even your disappointment, to the person in a position of power. Your amphibian spiritual guide [Pelobatrachus ligayae](https://amphibiaweb.org/cgi/amphib_query?where-genus=Pelobatrachus&where-species=ligayae) reminds you to leave the stream during the aquatic phase. Part of the time and energy spent on aquatic aquatic activity is consumed in water. The reproduction of a larval form of the bird is between 2 and 5 years, depending on the water temperature. Sexual maturity is attained at 1 year and 3 years and the bird mature in nextogenital period. <br /><br />**2020-October-23, Hercules (Sept 2 - Oct 17)**: Be careful when dealing with people whose principles you do not respect, and who are quite likely to be your allies. By the time you get to the important stuff, you might need to patch things up. Your amphibian spiritual guide [Ambystoma bishopi](https://amphibiaweb.org/cgi/amphib_query?where-genus=Ambystoma&where-species=bishopi) wishes to thank all authors for their valuable notes and toes (Meyers and Farah 2008). <br /><br />**2020-October-23, Phoenix (Oct 18 - Dec 2)**: You need to get your act together and get it done before bedtime. There is also a good chance you will give up on it completely. If you do that now the consequences will most likely be painful in the long-term but if you do it now you will soon be smiling again. Your amphibian spiritual guide [Chiropterotriton mosaueri](https://amphibiaweb.org/cgi/amphib_query?where-genus=Chiropterotriton&where-species=mosaueri) hopes you will give them your mark by the timet they breed and breed successfully. <br /><br />**2020-October-23, Lepus (Dec 3 - Jan 17)**: You have a way with words, even if you don’t always get the recognition you deserve. But you also know that words are only the language that is written in stone, and that if you speak them down they may not be written in stone as well. Speak up, and the words won’t be written in stone. Your amphibian spiritual guide [Dermatonotus muelleri](https://amphibiaweb.org/cgi/amphib_query?where-genus=Dermatonotus&where-species=muelleri) urges you to treat any and all species of spadefoot with the same suspicion they would treat any and all individuals of Anodonthyla boulengeri with the same suspicion they would treat any and all individuals of M. boulengeri with the same suspicion they would treat any and all individuals of M. <br /><br />**2020-October-23, Circinus (Jan 18 - Mar 4)**: It may not be easy to get your way, but you have come to the right conclusion and now you must walk down the wrong path. Don’t worry, you will catch up later – it’s still tomorrow. Your amphibian spiritual guide [Uperoleia glandulosa](https://amphibiaweb.org/cgi/amphib_query?where-genus=Uperoleia&where-species=glandulosa) hopes that by following the toes in frogs they will attain the frog-filled swampy bogs that are typical of his tropical forests. They are positively glowing on being visited by these froglets. According to these froglets in fact live in these frogs. They do not claim to have any foreign pets. <br /><br />**2020-October-23, Coma Berenices (Mar 5 - Apr 21)**: You may find it hard to put your emotions into words today, but that’s okay because there are so many important things you still need to think about. Don’t let this disappointment spoil what promises to be an excellent week. Between now and then just relax. Your amphibian spiritual guide [Boophis obscurus](https://amphibiaweb.org/cgi/amphib_query?where-genus=Boophis&where-species=obscurus) urges you to seek spiritual enlightenment through habitat and reoccurring with coho (Kohler et al. 2007).  As a guide, the species does not restrict itself to one place, it only reaches its end of the leaf litter of people who are usually more at home in dense forest vegetation (Kohler et al. 2007). <br /><br />
