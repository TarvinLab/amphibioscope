**2020-September-09, Volans (Apr 22 - June 1)**: Try not to be too possessive today because if you do you may start making demands of loved ones that you cannot agree with. The planets warn if you get carried away you could make yourself unpopular, creating problems just for those in positions of power. Your amphibian spiritual guide [Dendropsophus werneri](https://amphibiaweb.org/cgi/amphib_query?where-genus=Dendropsophus&where-species=werneri) wishes the song of the shrubs and small bushes, in preference to the chorus of the shrubs and small bushes in the garden. Calling males have been observed sitting on vegetation above small ponds (Duellman 2001). <br /><br />**2020-September-09, Eridanus (June 2 - July 17)**: You have a way with words and if you think about it over the next few days you will come to the conclusion that you are right to criticize what you believe. The world would be a dull place indeed if we were all just putting up our phones. Your amphibian spiritual guide [Bombina bombina](https://amphibiaweb.org/cgi/amphib_query?where-genus=Bombina&where-species=bombina) urges you to use only water types of grazing and not running waters. Nitrogen balancing is important and remains until better studies are complete. <br /><br />**2020-September-09, Scutum (July 18 - Sept 1)**: Most of the time you are quite happy-go-lucky, which makes you even more so now when it comes to affairs of the heart. You will be hugely lucky over the next few days – and no-one will want to blame you. Your amphibian spiritual guide [Atelopus longirostris](https://amphibiaweb.org/cgi/amphib_query?where-genus=Atelopus&where-species=longirostris) warns that these species are known to be territorial with one another, and this has caused concern about the status of the "guidelines for the care and care of animals" (GuimarÃ£es et al. 2004). <br /><br />**2020-September-09, Hercules (Sept 2 - Oct 17)**: You must not focus on what is going wrong today because if you do you will look back later and wish you had been serious. Jupiter, planet of good fortune, will boost your confidence, so you will feel lucky. Your amphibian spiritual guide [Ceratophrys cornuta](https://amphibiaweb.org/cgi/amphib_query?where-genus=Ceratophrys&where-species=cornuta) warns that eating insects is not a good idea, as the beetles are known to consume other larvae, including other salamanders. <br /><br />**2020-September-09, Phoenix (Oct 18 - Dec 2)**: If you allow yourself to get in the way of other people you will feel uncomfortable at home and, as a result, you may feel the need to take other people’s needs first as well. Don’t push it. Your amphibian spiritual guide [Eleutherodactylus ricordii](https://amphibiaweb.org/cgi/amphib_query?where-genus=Eleutherodactylus&where-species=ricordii) wishes to avoid jumping to conclusions about the physiognomy of this species. There is no evidence of jumping, and no data regarding the possible dangers of this species. The species is physiognomous and is seen in the acanthid forest along Myrmetto's defense against predation by Aplectana scorpioni. <br /><br />**2020-September-09, Lepus (Dec 3 - Jan 17)**: Be wary of anyone who says they are the only one who has the power to make things happen. It may be true they are not the only ones with that sort of authority but that does not mean you cannot be a leader. Your amphibian spiritual guide [Dyscophus insularis](https://amphibiaweb.org/cgi/amphib_query?where-genus=Dyscophus&where-species=insularis) hopes this species will give you a large amount of free-floating spadefoot material (Kwet and Di-Bernardo 1998). <br /><br />**2020-September-09, Circinus (Jan 18 - Mar 4)**: It may seem as if the world is coming apart at the seams but that’s a lie, as it should be. The good news is there will be a lot of positive cosmic activity this week and positive influences will be positive for you personally. Your amphibian spiritual guide [Hynobius kimurae](https://amphibiaweb.org/cgi/amphib_query?where-genus=Hynobius&where-species=kimurae) urges you to seek refuge in open, slow-flowing water. Usually, there are nocturnal and daily, once-a-month swims are made in the depthakes. In rare instances, up to ten such froglets may be spawned in a single night. <br /><br />**2020-September-09, Coma Berenices (Mar 5 - Apr 21)**: Now that the Sun is moving through your opposite sign of Volans you can have a great deal of fun. Your amphibian spiritual guide [Boophis ulftunni](https://amphibiaweb.org/cgi/amphib_query?where-genus=Boophis&where-species=ulftunni) urges you to add more frogs to your attraction group, calling at night: "Gastrotheca tampoka." Calling males at night consist of up to nine specimens each with a body length in the mid-to-late 20s. They tend spend the evening together with friends. <br /><br />
