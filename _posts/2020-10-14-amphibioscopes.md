**2020-October-14, Volans (Apr 22 - June 1)**: You may be the kind of Volans who keeps your emotions under control but that won’t stop you getting emotional today. The more you shout at people the more likely it is they will make life-changing decisions for you. Your amphibian spiritual guide [Litoria pearsoniana](https://amphibiaweb.org/cgi/amphib_query?where-genus=Litoria&where-species=pearsoniana) urges you to avoid feelings of jealousy and rather look for information on mating, calling, coloration, calling environment. Individuals of C. pylori call in brightly colored rooms with narrow curtains, and with narrow depressions on the vocal sacs. <br /><br />**2020-October-14, Eridanus (June 2 - July 17)**: You will need to be on top of your game today, especially on the work front where you should be working as if you are the kind of Sag who never lets things slide.

You know you deserve to be well rewarded and what happens today will remind you that you are worth more than you think, and that nothing is as good as it. Your amphibian spiritual guide [Oreolalax granulosus](https://amphibiaweb.org/cgi/amphib_query?where-genus=Oreolalax&where-species=granulosus) urges you to take a walking walk in the water where the musculature is largest (about 1.5 mm in diameter) is the largest part of its body (a musculature measuring less than an inch across) and sit quietly on it. This will encourage the musculature to grow much beyond the skin length. <br /><br />**2020-October-14, Hercules (Sept 2 - Oct 17)**: If you have not yet made the most of your opportunities you are in one of those moods that will lift your spirits as the week progresses. Be bold and be the one who stands out from the crowd – it will be you. Your amphibian spiritual guide [Ameerega shihuemoy](https://amphibiaweb.org/cgi/amphib_query?where-genus=Ameerega&where-species=shihuemoy) warns that the name Phyllobates lehmanni (whose modernization is based on a resemblance to the sound of a high-pitched cricket) is likely an exaggeration. It is actually a similar sound, and may be a warning call instead. It may have a mean-lived repeating duration of about 38 months (Walls 1994). <br /><br />**2020-October-14, Phoenix (Oct 18 - Dec 2)**: You will have to give up on something that means a lot to you but the planets indicate it must eventually be put on the back burner. You don’t have to be the life and soul of the party every weekend – go out and have fun with people you care for. Your amphibian spiritual guide [Bolitoglossa sooyorum](https://amphibiaweb.org/cgi/amphib_query?where-genus=Bolitoglossa&where-species=sooyorum) reminds you to stay well away from water sources, especially bromeliads.

In all directions, B. <br /><br />**2020-October-14, Lepus (Dec 3 - Jan 17)**: You must resist the temptation to get involved in cause and effect and to focus only on the positive side of your life. Other people’s problems are directly related to your problems, so nothing will happen to you from day one. Your amphibian spiritual guide [Stumpffia gimmeli](https://amphibiaweb.org/cgi/amphib_query?where-genus=Stumpffia&where-species=gimmeli) hopes that by creating a detailed account of the living and feeding habits of these frog he can give a more detailed picture of their lifestyle than most other spadefoots. <br /><br />**2020-October-14, Circinus (Jan 18 - Mar 4)**: This is a perfect day for you to take just about anything and everything that you please with you: lunch, dinner, dinner, and even the office. Your amphibian spiritual guide [Neobatrachus aquilonius](https://amphibiaweb.org/cgi/amphib_query?where-genus=Neobatrachus&where-species=aquilonius) warns that the call may bekef (a short metallic blunter). This species does not hibernate and lays its eggs in the foam nests that it encounters, but it does so at considerable risk to itself. Its instincts will override those of the human ear. <br /><br />**2020-October-14, Coma Berenices (Mar 5 - Apr 21)**: If your cashflow situation is not as good as you would like it to be, then don’t worry. What happens this weekend will put it all behind you and give you a chance to be a bit more adventurous. Don’t just reward those who help you.
