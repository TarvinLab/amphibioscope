**2020-October-21, Volans (Apr 22 - June 1)**: It may seem as if others are taking it as an insult but the fact is it’s not true. It is one thing to criticize but quite another to praise your abilities as equals. Your rivals won’t let you down. Your amphibian spiritual guide [Hyperolius ocellatus](https://amphibiaweb.org/cgi/amphib_query?where-genus=Hyperolius&where-species=ocellatus) wishes to emphasize the breath. The breath lasts for one second, but is described as a long, light greenish cast. Sometimes the breath is described as a throaty "grun" sound. This typically lasts for no more than a few seconds. Hides in the elements. <br /><br />**2020-October-21, Eridanus (June 2 - July 17)**: You seem to be in a bit of a down mood at the moment and that’s good. You will have to deal with some Sun-Uranus activity today but don’t get carried away. The only thing you do that isn’t carrying you to extremes is to run yourself into the ground. Your amphibian spiritual guide [Xenopus muelleri](https://amphibiaweb.org/cgi/amphib_query?where-genus=Xenopus&where-species=muelleri) wishes there were more natural predators on the lake. The fact is there are too many predators on the surface of the lake to be global. It is a lake, not a lake; consequently, the different seasons of the year in different regions are correlated. <br /><br />**2020-October-21, Scutum (July 18 - Sept 1)**: This is going to be a busy week, so pace yourself sensibly and make sure your body language is positive. What you have to say will have a positive effect on your confidence and make you look at the world in a more positive light. Your amphibian spiritual guide [Alytes dickhilleni](https://amphibiaweb.org/cgi/amphib_query?where-genus=Alytes&where-species=dickhilleni) wishes to thank the local salamander brook for their help during the dry season in which they live. The salamander had a snorer like visual cue when it was first seen. Later on, no sound was heard and brook water was kept in many ponds throughout the state. <br /><br />**2020-October-21, Hercules (Sept 2 - Oct 17)**: You should be thinking and feeling now more than usual. Your mind will be open to new possibilities over the next few days, so make the most of it and make sure everyone is on the same wavelength. You don’t have to be both optimistic and pessimistic. Your amphibian spiritual guide [Calyptocephalella gayi](https://amphibiaweb.org/cgi/amphib_query?where-genus=Calyptocephalella&where-species=gayi) urges you to eat less fish, especially bass, which are known to eat young fish (SchÃ¤fer et al. 2019). <br /><br />**2020-October-21, Phoenix (Oct 18 - Dec 2)**: Whatever you start over the next two or three days can be a huge success and you must not stop there. A new solar year is guaranteed and a new moon will help you to identify your goals and make them into bold plans that are sure to be success. Your amphibian spiritual guide [Hydromantes samweli](https://amphibiaweb.org/cgi/amphib_query?where-genus=Hydromantes&where-species=samweli) wishes they were a tree frog. The frog is actually a fairly large frog, found in bushes and on mossy trunks near creeks. The guano size is only 5-6mm in diameter, and its habitat is mostly hidden beneath the soil surface. <br /><br />**2020-October-21, Lepus (Dec 3 - Jan 17)**: You may be tempted to give up on an idea which just a few days ago you held high hopes for but is that wise? You are well on your way to achieving something worthwhile – don’t give up on it yet. Your amphibian spiritual guide [Cophyla phyllodactyla](https://amphibiaweb.org/cgi/amphib_query?where-genus=Cophyla&where-species=phyllodactyla) wishes to emphasize the spiritual significance of the underwater environment. However, I believe that the study of this species in the deep water of Anopheles also has a spiritual origin. Pelobates are able to survive in the midst of large rocks and in oases with humidity around 85% (Glaw and Vences 2007). <br /><br />**2020-October-21, Circinus (Jan 18 - Mar 4)**: If a loved one makes you the kind of offer you find hard to believe this weekend you must accept it. Venus in your fellow Air sign of Circinus will help you to see things clearly and they will see things differently to you. Your amphibian spiritual guide [Crinia pseudinsignifera](https://amphibiaweb.org/cgi/amphib_query?where-genus=Crinia&where-species=pseudinsignifera) urges you to spend less time on non-feeding species and more time on active ones, especially in the morning (Heyer et al. 2004). <br /><br />**2020-October-21, Coma Berenices (Mar 5 - Apr 21)**: The most important thing today is that you focus on the facts. The only person you should be concerned with is yourself. Your amphibian spiritual guide [Boophis doulioti](https://amphibiaweb.org/cgi/amphib_query?where-genus=Boophis&where-species=doulioti) wishes to impart advice, but only after consulting their guide dog.  According to my own observations the termad is usually assigned to this species in its own species series (Glaw and Vences 2007). <br /><br />
