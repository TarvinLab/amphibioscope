## About Amphibioscope  

Amphibioscope is a project of the [Tarvin Lab @ UC Berkeley](www.tarvinlab.org). In the summer of 2020 our group decided to spend lab meetings over a 12-week period to build a bot that somehow blended daily horoscopes with information about amphibians from [AmphibiaWeb](www.amphibiaweb.org). First, we looked through all amphibian families and grouped them into eight sets, each of which has some common characteristics. Then we assigned each group different constellations from the [International Astronomical Union](https://www.iau.org/public/themes/constellations/) based on how we imagined each group of amphibians could be represented symbolically. The symbols for each constellation were designed by Denis Moskowitz, who generously made his artwork available to the public domain ([here](https://www.suberic.net/~dmm/astro/constellations.html)). We wrote descriptions for each sign with the help of a professional astrologer. 

To produce daily horoscope text, we used the [OpenAI Generative Pretrained Transformer 2](https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/), which is a language model that can produce mostly intelligible text following a given prompt. We trained the model on several datasets, one including horoscopes and eight including species accounts containing amphibian life history information from each set of amphibians. The daily horoscope for each sign every day is a combination of a horoscope generated by this AI model and a statement from a randomly selected species of each group, which is also written by the AI, using the species name as a prompt. Hence, **we note that the amphibian information included in daily horoscopes is written by a computer program and meant to look real -- but it is not**. 

Version 1 of amphibioscope was launched on xx August 2020. The contributors include, in alphabetical order: Tyler Douglas, Kate Montana, María José Navarette, Kannon Pearson, Valeria Ramírez-Castañeda, Rebecca Tarvin, Connor Tumelty, and Lawrence Uricchio.
